<h1>Firing Squad Synchronization</h1>
This project takes a look at Abraham Waksman and Jacques Mazoyer's solutions to the firing squad synchronization problem. The final product uses test_mazoyer.py, which imports mazoyer_rules.py, and outputs (a) tsv file(s) to the MazoyerOutput directory containing a chart of the state transitions until fire.
